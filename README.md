# Writeup

I noticed that there were some errors in fig 2 with the syntax (missing semicolons). 
The instructions are clear enough, and the fig 2 is very helpful in determining what is expected.
However, I think that the way that this code will be tested should be made more clear, and an example of how exactly the output should look given the example would be good.
